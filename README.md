# Atharva Kamble

Hi there, I am Atharva Kamble, an experienced fullstack engineer and a recent grad with an MS in Software Engineering Systems from Northeastern University. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software generalist - because of my fundamental understanding of tech and programming, it helps me learn new frameworks and build higher-level knowledge quickly. In my free time, I like to build meaningful projects that try to fulfill a use case - and most importantly, generate impact.

Open to SDE and fullstack roles across the US.
