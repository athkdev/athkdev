# Atharva Kamble

Hi there, I am Atharva Kamble, an experienced fullstack engineer and a recent grad with an MS in Software Engineering Systems from Northeastern University. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software generalist - because of my fundamental understanding of tech and programming, it helps me learn new frameworks and build higher-level knowledge quickly. In my free time, I like to build meaningful projects that try to fulfill a use case - and most importantly, generate impact.

Open to SDE and fullstack roles across the US.

# FAQ about me!
### What are you doing currently?
```
I am working on bemyroomie - I noticed that during moving season,
the process of finding roommates is chaotic especially for college
students. There are lots of back and forth, whatsapp and telegram
groups - bemyroomie is streamlining it and giving college students
a seamless experience in an already chaotic world.

### What technologies do you specialize in?
```
I specialize in building end-to-end web products with Next.js, Typescript, GoLang, Java,
Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vercel, Git, Unix, Neovim.

As LLMs rose, I have gracefully adopted them in my workflow to use Cursor, and Claude mostly.
But I have been coding since the pre-GPT era, so I do refer the ancient texts (stackoverflow)
whenever LLMs fail.

### What's one product that you are really proud of?
```
model0 - LLM orchestration tool

A full-stack application enabling rapid creation, fine-tuning, and deployment of large language models (LLMs)
using AWS SageMaker. Utilized Python, MySQL, React.js, and AWS EC2 to deliver a high-performance, scalable infrastructure.

The objective of the project was that, I noticed that there was a need amongst developers who wanted to deploy AI chatbots,
and ML models ASAP. But such tools were not readily available.
